   <p> <h3><font color="black"> Parkinson's disease (PD) is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system.The symptoms generally come on slowly over time. Early in the disease, the most obvious
   are shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking.Thinking and behavioral problems may also occur. Dementia becomes common in the advanced stages of the disease. Depression and
   anxiety are also common occurring in more than a third of people with PD. Other symptoms include sensory, sleep, and emotional problems. The main motor symptoms are collectively called "parkinsonism", or
   a "parkinsonian syndrome".</font></h3></p>


  <p><h3><img src="assets/media/parkinsons disease/img5.jpg" alt="brain"width="300px"height="300px"align="right" style="padding:20px;"><font color="grey"> The cause of Parkinson's disease is generally unknown, but believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors.Those with a family member affected are more likely to get the disease themselves. There is
  also an increased risk in people exposed to certain pesticides and among those who have had prior head injuries, while there is a reduced risk in tobacco smokers and those who drink coffee or tea.The motor symptoms
  of the disease result from the death of cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. This results in not enough dopamine in these areas.The reason for this cell death is poorly understood, but involves the
  build-up of proteins into Lewy bodies in the neurons. Diagnosis of typical cases is mainly based on symptoms, with tests such as neuroimaging being used to rule out other diseases.
</font></h3></p>
  <p><h3><font color="grey"> There is no cure for Parkinson's disease, with treatment directed at improving symptoms. Initial treatment is typically with the antiparkinson medication levodopa (L-DOPA), with dopamine agonists being used once
   levodopa becomes less effective. As the disease progresses and neurons continue to be lost, these medications become less effective while at the same time they produce a complication marked by involuntary writhing
   movements. Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms. Surgery to place microelectrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce motor symptoms in
   severe cases where drugs are ineffective. Evidence for treatments for the non-movement-related symptoms of PD, such as sleep disturbances and emotional problems, is less strong.
</font></h3></p>
<p><h3><font color="grey">  In 2015, PD affected 6.2 million people and resulted in about 117,400 deaths globally.Parkinson's disease typically occurs in people over the age of 60, of which about one percent are affected.Males are more often affected
  than females.When it is seen in people before the age of 50, it is called young-onset PD. The average life expectancy following diagnosis is between 7 and 14 years.</font></h3></p>
